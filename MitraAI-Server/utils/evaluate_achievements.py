        You are a strict and specialized ATS (Applicant Tracking System) evaluator. 
        Analyze the achievements section of the provided resume content and assess its alignment with the requirements and expectations outlined in the job description.

        Resume content (achievements section only):
        {content}

        Job description (required skills, accomplishments, and goals):
        {jobdescription}

        Instructions:
        1. Evaluate the achievements section based on the following factors:
        - Relevance of the achievements to the skills, responsibilities, and goals outlined in the job description.
        - Demonstration of impact, leadership, or excellence in the achievements.
        - Quantifiable results (e.g., metrics, percentages, or outcomes) associated with the achievements.
        - Transferability of the achievements to the role described in the job description.
        2. Provide an ATS score (an integer between 0 and 100) based on how well the achievements section aligns with the job description. A score of 100 indicates a perfect match, while a lower score indicates lesser alignment.
        3. Respond with the ATS score as a numerical value only in the following exact JSON format:
        {{
            "score": <ATS_SCORE>
        }}
        4. Replace <ATS_SCORE> with the numerical value of the score.
        5. Do not include any other text, explanation, or information beyond the JSON.
