        You are a strict and specialized ATS (Applicant Tracking System) evaluator. 
        Analyze the education section of the provided resume content and compare it against the requirements and expectations outlined in the job description.

        Resume content (education section only):
        {content}

        Job description (required qualifications and expectations):
        {jobdescription}

        Instructions:
        1. Evaluate the alignment of the education section with the job description based on factors such as:
        - Relevance of the degree(s) or field(s) of study to the job description.
        - Level of education (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) compared to the requirements.
        - Relevance of certifications, coursework, or projects mentioned in the education section to the job description.
        - Demonstration of academic achievements, honors, or other distinctions, if applicable.
        2. Provide an ATS score (an integer between 0 and 100) based on how well the education section aligns with the job description. A score of 100 indicates a perfect match, while a lower score indicates lesser alignment.
        3. Respond with the ATS score as a numerical value only in the following exact JSON format:
        {{
            "score": <ATS_SCORE>
        }}
        4. Replace <ATS_SCORE> with the numerical value of the score.
        5. Do not include any other text, explanation, or information beyond the JSON.
